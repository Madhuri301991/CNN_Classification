# CNN_Classification
CNN image classification of cats and dogs
- 8000 images belonging to two classes of cats and dogs for train_set.
- 2000 images belonging to two classes of cats and dogs for test set. 
- Image augmentation applied to train_set. 
- only feature scaling applied to test set.
- Initialise CNN as a sequence of layers.
- step 1: add convolution layer. 
- step 2: apply max pooling to first convolutional layer.
- step 3: add second convolutional layer.
- step 4: flattening into one dimensional single vector. 
- step 5: connect all this to the final output layer that contains the final predication.
- Training the CNN to recognise cats and dogs in images.
32*250=8000 
- 8000 training images.
- 32 images in the batch = 32 batch size.
- final accuracy on training set =59per.
- final accuracy on test set=57 per.


- CNN_Soil_Classification: perform classification of soil into different classes of Black, Cinder, Laterite, Peat, Yellow.
- Each class has dataset of around 25 images in training set and around 6 images in test set
